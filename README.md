# Dynamic Objective MPC for Motion Planning of Seamless Docking Maneuvers
This repository contains the code of the IEEE IV2025 paper called "Dynamic Objective MPC for Motion Planning of Seamless Docking Maneuvers".

This algorithm is based on a model predictive contouring controller (MPCC) created in acados, which is improved by the methods proposed in this paper.
These changes allow for high-precision motion planning along a reference path while being able to reach specific goal poses at the same time without stopping or switching completely to the controller.

Especially in docking scenarios, this is a common use case.

⚙️ The code of this repository will be available after final acceptance.
